# [Question Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-distance-between-two-numbers/1/?track=amazon-arrays&batchId=192#)

# You are given an array A, of N elements. Find minimum index based distance between two elements of the array, x and y.

# Example 1:
# min distance between two numbers
# Input:
# N = 4
# A[] = {1,2,3,2}
# x = 1, y = 2
# Output: 1
# Explanation: x = 1 and y = 2. There are
# two distances between x and y, which are
# 1 and 3 out of which the least is 1.
# Example 2:

# Input:
# N = 7
# A[] = {86,39,90,67,84,66,62}
# x = 42, y = 12
# Output: -1
# Explanation: x = 42 and y = 12. We return
# -1 as x and y don't exist in the array.
# Your Task:
# Complete the function minDist() which takes the array, n, x and y as input parameters and returns the minimum distance between x and y in the array. If no such distance is possible then return -1.

# Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

# Constraints:
# 1 <= N <= 105
# 0 <= A[i], x, y <= 105

# Python Solution
```
import sys

class Solution:
    def minDist(self, arr, n, x, y):
        index_x = -1
        index_y = -1
        diff = sys.maxsize
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == x:
                index_x = i
            if arr[i] == y:
                index_y = i
            
            if index_x != -1 and index_y != -1:
                diff = min(diff,abs(index_x-index_y))
        
        if diff == sys.maxsize:
            return -1
        return diff
